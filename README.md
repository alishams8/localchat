# localchat

With the advent of new open-source tools like Llama 3.1, you can now build chat applications on your PC at zero cost and even run them offline.

No need for ChatGPT any more :) 

## To run your own local chat app, end-to-end:

The Makefile is set up to allow you to run your preferred model on macOS, Linux, or Windows. To install all requirements and run the app, run following command. It will get all the dependencies and start the app, in localhost:3000

```
make all
```

To run each step individually, select the corresponding tag. For example:

```
make run_frontend
```
